# ML Resources
There is plethora of resources available online to learn Machine Learning. At times, the list of resources is overwhemling, which could discourage starters or make you feel like you are soooo far behind everyone else. Here is a not-so-daunting list of resources for novice in ML, enough to get you off your feet, so that you can make sense of all those long lists, pick and learn topics of your choice. DISCLAIMER: This list is based on my journey in learning Machine Learning, different people learn in different ways, pick what works best for you.

- **Getting started in ML** : 
    - Stanford Intro to ML course taught by Andrew Ng on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&amp=&index=1) or similar content via coursera (Courera has assignments using Octave which is kinda outdated) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#syllabu)
    - Crisp hands-on short courses by [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) or by [IBM on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-a-practical-introduct)
- **Getting started in DL** : 
    - My absolute favorite (Gives enough depth to understand breadth of major DL concepts) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (Auditing is free, though I found great value in doing all the assignments, for which you need to pay a nominal subscription fee. Scholarships avilable too)
    - Or another Highly recommended course on [Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)
- Simple example notebooks to get hands-on practice of basics on [Github](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition)
- ABC of NLP concepts on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)
- ABC of Computer Vision by [Stanford](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/)
- Great visual illustrations of few concepts in AI - [link to Blog](http://jalammar.github.io/)


#### Now that you know basic building blocks of ML, here are some overwhelming lists to pursue to go beyond basics, or if you don't understand some topic, or want to understand something indepth:
- Topic wise good resources by [Montreal.ai](https://montrealartificialintelligence.com/academy/)
- A comprehensive list of courses in AI: [Course list](https://deep-learning-drizzle.github.io/)
- Medium Resource list [link](https://medium.com/machine-learning-in-practice/my-curated-list-of-ai-and-machine-learning-resources-from-around-the-web-9a97823b8524)
