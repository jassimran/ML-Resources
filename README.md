# ML Resources
There is plethora of resources available online to learn Machine Learning. At time the list of resources is overwhemling, which could discourage starters or make you feel like you are soooo behind everyone else. Here is limited list, enough to get you off your feet, so that you can make sense of all those big lists, pick and learn topics of your choice.

- **Getting started in ML** : 
    - Stanford Intro to ML course taught by Andrew Ng: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&amp=&index=1 or 
    - Or similar content via coursera (Courera has assignments using Octave which is kinda outdated): https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#syllabu
    - https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course
- **Getting started in DL** : 
    - My absolute favorite (Gives enough depth to understand breadth of major DL concepts): https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning (Auditing is free, though I found great value in doing all the assignments, for which you need to pay a nominal subscription fee. Scholarships avilable too)
    - Or another Highly recommended course: https://course.fast.ai/
- Simple example notebooks to get hands-on practice of basics : https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition
- A to Z of NLP concepts: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing
- A to Z of Computer Vision: http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/
- Great visual illustrations of few concepts in AI - http://jalammar.github.io/

#### Some overwhelming lists to pursue once you understand the basics, or if you don't understand some topic, or want to understand something indepth:
- Topic wise good resources https://montrealartificialintelligence.com/academy/
- A comprehensive list of courses in AI: https://deep-learning-drizzle.github.io/
